# Mongoose

Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

## Installation

> npm i mongoose

## Importing
```javascript
// Using Node.js `require()`
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
 
// Using ES6 imports
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
```
## Connecting to MongoDB

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
 
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/my_database', {useNewUrlParser: true});
```
## Defining a Model

Models are defined through the Schema interface.

```javascript
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
const ObjectId = Schema.ObjectId;
 
const BlogPost = new Schema({
  author: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  body: String,
  date: Date
});
```
 ## Accessing a Model

 Once we define a model through mongoose.model('ModelName', mySchema), we can access it through the same function.

```javascript
 const MyModel = mongoose.model('ModelName', mySchema);
 ```

# mongoose-unique-validator

mongoose-unique-validator is a plugin which adds pre-save validation for unique fields within a Mongoose schema.

> npm i mongoose-unique-validator

https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-unique-validator

```javascript
// on model.js
 var uniqueValidator = require('mongoose-unique-validator');

 var mySchema = mongoose.Schema(/* put your schema definition here */);
 mySchema.plugin(uniqueValidator);
 ```

# bcrypt

bcrypt is a password hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David MaziÃ¨res, based on the Blowfish cipher, and presented at USENIX in 1999. Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power.

The bcrypt function is the default password hash algorithm for OpenBSD and other systems including some Linux distributions such as SUSE Linux.

There are implementations of bcrypt for C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Elixir, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and other languages.

> npm i bcrypt

https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt

```javascript
 var hash = bcrypt.hashSync(myPlaintextPassword, salt);
 ```
